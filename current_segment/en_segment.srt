00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,270
What's wrong, Yukko?

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,730
I can't summon the motivation to do anything.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,200
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,440
We're high school students, you know.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,740
It's the start of a new term.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,580
Motivation is something that comes out naturally once you start doing it.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,950
The motivation to do something before actually doing it won't come out.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,490
How do I get motivated to do
something before I actually start doing it?

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,500
The motivation to do something before actually doing it?

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,630
Hm...

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,710
Anyway, just do it!

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,630
All right!
